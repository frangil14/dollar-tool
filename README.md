# üí∞ Dollar Tool

Argentina has experienced significant economic instability in recent years, with high inflation rates and multiple exchange rate systems. This volatility has made it crucial for individuals and businesses to monitor different dollar exchange rates across various platforms to find the best deals.

**Dollar Tool** is a real-time price tracking application that monitors different dollar types (Blue Dollar, Crypto) and their variations compared to the Argentine peso. Born from the need to quickly compare exchange rates across multiple platforms and track historical trends, this personal project was created as an initiative to explore modern web development practices while building something useful for Argentina's complex economic landscape.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

This application uses **optimized multi-stage Docker builds** for both backend and frontend, resulting in smaller, more secure production images.

### Key Docker Optimizations
- **Multi-stage builds** - Separate build and production stages
- **Alpine Linux** - Lightweight base images
- **Non-root users** - Enhanced security
- **Layer caching** - Optimized build times
- **Minimal dependencies** - Only production packages in final images

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
